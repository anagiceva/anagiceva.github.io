    <!-- SCENE 1 -->
    <div id ="scene1">
      <p>Sun streams through the tall trees. Golden leaves line the dusty path. You listen to the birds' sweet songs as you observe the everchanging forest around you.  "The Infinite Forest," it was nicknamed, which effectively scared off any tourists from the area. Lost in your thoughts, you barely notice you've come to the entrance of a fork in the road. The paths were identical; both stretched deeper into the quiet woods. Both would bring a peaceful autumn afternoon, or so you thought. <b>Which way will you go? </b> </p>

    <div id = "scene2" class = "scene">
      <p> You start down the left path. Not a kilometre in, the path begins to twist and turn. You make dozens of turns, and walk for hours in the dense forest, never reaching a destination. It’s safe to say you are lost. What a waste of a day, you think. You are fatigued, hungry, and thirsty. The thought of your comfortable home is the only thing that can put a smile on your face right now. But you had already walked so far, perhaps the next turn would bring an adventure? But, probably not. What will you do?

    <div id = "scene3" class = "scene">
      <p> The right path has brought you an obstacle filled afternoon. In just an hour, you’ve crossed a piranha filled pond, tripped over three logs, and been chased by a swarm of bees. Clearly, Mother Nature didn’t want you seeing what was on the other end of the path. Frustrated, you walk with your head down; it’s not like you’d bump into anyone, you were the only person silly enough to go to the Infinite Forest. You walk, sighing, and are thinking to turn around and go home, when your head hits something. You look up to find a massive wall made of stone bricks in front of you. You run back to get a better picture: a beautiful castle stands before you, peeking through the tops of the trees. Was this just a hallucination? You couldn’t believe your eyes. It probably is, as you are tired, hungry and thirsty. But, what if it isn’t? Who knows what lies inside? What will you do?

      <p>When had that happened? More importantly, how? You had never seen anything like this. The wind howls through the trees. You shudder at the eerie noise, and try and continue your journey through the strange forest. However, you don’t get far, as a cackling noise fills your ears. Looking through the <span id= "colorname"></span> haze, you make out a structure in the distance: a small wooden cottage, where the cackling was coming from. The sky, the cottage, the cackling; it all made sense. There was a witch in this forest. You’re curiosity burns, you thought witches only existed in fairy tales! However, they aren’t known as the friendliest of creatures. What will you do? </p>

    <!-- SCENE 5 (CASTLE) -->
    <div id = "scene5" class = "scene">
      <p>The castle was enormous. You circled it for an hour until finally finding the arched entrance.</p>

      <img src = "img/entrance.jpg">
      
      <p>Looking through, you see a medieval market place, filled with hundreds of people and dozens of stalls. It was all bordered by the thick walls of the castle, with windows and balconies sticking out. You look at the back wall, and see a beautiful balcony made of gold and quartz, where a man on a throne and a woman with a crown stood, sternly looking over their kingdom. What a strange world. As you stand in the entrance, a little girl runs up to you. She has her hair in braids and wears rags. The  child says nothing, and just gives you a </p>

      <p> "Why, thank you." you say. "What's your name?" <br>
      "Genevieve. Are you going to come inside? I'm sure the king and queen won't suspect you. I can help you hide." <br> 
      "Suspect me?" Am I not allowed to come in?" <br>
      "They weren't exactly pleased with the last 'forest goers' who visited." <br>
      This kingdom looks medieval, and you knew all about the dangers of that period. If you were to break rules, and enter the castle when you weren't allowed, the consequences could be brutal. But, was it worth the risk to explore this strange civilization in the forest? <br>
      "Well, shall we go?" The girl eagerly questions. 
      You answer her: </p>

    <!-- SCENE 6 (TRY TO GO HOME) -->
    <div id = "scene6" class = "scene">
      <p> You decide to start going home, as it was the safest option, or so you thought. You begin walking back along the path, and notice something is different. Everything is calmer now, and your walk was going relatively peacefully! You even find an old apple tree that keeps your stomach from grumbling any longer. You stand under the tree, eating, and wondering if you should go back to the castle. Suddenly, an apple lands on your head. In your weak state, this causes you to lose your balance. You tumble down the uneven terrain, right into an algae filled pond. Pulling yourself onto the shore, covered in green moss, you let out a heavy sigh. <em>Okay,</em> you think,<em> I’m getting home as fast as I can.</em> </p>

    <!-- SCENE 7 (KNOCK ON DOOR) -->
    <div id = "scene7" class = "scene">
      <p> You decide to take your chances with the witch. You'd always wondered if they were real, and this was your only chance to see one. The wind had grown stronger, and the haze thicker. It's like you are in a <span id= "colorname2"></span> tornado. Pushing against the wind, you finally make it to the door. Before you get the chance to knock. the wind swings it open. A short creature with dry black hair and purple robes stands with her back to you. She is in a small and dirty room, filled with hundreds oF miscellanious objects. The sound of her cackling acompanies the noise of banging shutters. You watch <span id= "colorname3"></span> bubbles fly over the witch's head, coming from the huge black cauldron in front of her. She continues to cackle, louder than the sound of all the chaos around her. "H-Hello there," you shout, your voice quivering. A glass vial drops out of her hand, shattering on the ground. Suddenly, the world goes quiet; the chaos stops, yet the sky remains its strange color. Maybe you could ask about that later. She slowly turns to you, and you can see the anger on her grisly face.</p>

      <p> "Who dares interupt me!" Her voice is like nails on a chalkboard.</p> 

      <p id = "name-sect"> "I'm  "<input type = "text" id="nameIn1">," you answer.</p>

      <p>With the flick of her wrist, the door slams behind you. She points one long nasty fingernail at you. 
      <br>"Since you <em>ruined</em> my spell, you must help me."
      <br>"What?" you ask, trying to mask your fear.
      <br> "You don't have a choice!" she screeches. She turns around to do something over her cauldron. "Now <span id="nameOut"></span>, take a seat, and we will discuss." With another flick of her wrist, a chair flies to you, almost taking you out. You quietly try to open the door behind you; it was locked. Your one chance of escape was the window to her right. It was wide open, you could run back out into the forest. But would you make it? Maybe this was a friendly witch, and you should just agree to help her. The witch was finishing up her work; you had to act fast. What will you do?</p>

      <p>You pass the cottage, and continue through the forest. Along the way, you hear a faint whimper coming from a tree. Looking around, you find a bright white puppy hiding beneath shurbbery. It must've been frightened by the still colorful sky. You pick it up and hold it. "Don't be scared, I'm sure it'll go back to normal soon." The puppy begins to ease up, and soon follows you as you continue your walk. You had decided on a name for him: "Benji," the perfect dog name in your opinion. You look back up at the sky: still <span id = "colorname7"></span> sky, and notice stone pillars now sticking out of the tops of trees. You run towards the structure, until you hit a stone wall. You walk back, to get a bigger picture; it was an enormous castle! What was a castle doing here in the middle of the forest? You'd soon find out. You and Benji begin walking around, trying to find the entrance, when suddenly, he dashes away. Benji! Come back, boy." Benji just keeps running, almost as if drawn to something. He wasn't the bravest dog, you knew he couldn't survive the rugged forest. But your curiosity burns, you have to know more about the castle! What are you going to do?</p>

Welcome to Tavalon Kingdom! Are you one of the forest goers we get every once in a while?” he asks.</p> 
      <br> “Oh, I guess so... <p id = "name-sect"> I'm  "<input type = "text" id="nameIn2">," you say.</p>

      <br>“May I help you?” you ask, not knowing what else to do.
      <br>“Why of course! The Tavalon marketplace is one of the few in the world so prosperous and busy! We need all the help we can get.” </p>

      <p> The old man leads you behind the table, and describes the way the market works. Then, you begin. Dozens of people come every hour. Not everyone is there to buy something, but some are just there to chat with you. You meet some very interesting people, such as a posh aristocratic lady and a poor baker with a french accent. You have lots of fun, and actually sell lots of fabric! As the sun sets, you count the money you made with the old man: 40 silver. <br>“Amazing!” Jack exclaims, “We can eat for a month with this amount! I am eternally grateful, <span id = "nameOut4"></span>.” 
      <br>“It was the most fun I’ve had in a while.” 
      <br>“Say, why don’t you stay with us, help us out some more?” You had an amazing day, and loved to help Jack’s family. Nevertheless, you had your own responsibilities to take care of back home. And besides, you still had no idea where you were, or if it was even real. But, it will be so difficult to leave these nice people you met. Perhaps you could come back every once in a while. You look at Jack’s expectant face, and answer him:</p>

      <p>Once you are finally home, you can’t stop thinking about your encounter in the forest. You thought about it for months. Had it really happened, or was it just a dream, you wondered. It sure felt real. Nevertheless, it inspired you in a way you've never been inspired before. So, a month after that strange day, you sat down at your desk. Hours later, you had a rough draft of a novel in front of you. “The Witch's Cottage,” it said on the front cover. It was a dramatic account of your experience with the witch. It painted her as an ugly tyrant, and you an extraordinary hero. It was a book that would make you laugh, cry, and sit on the edge of your seat. You can’t wait to take it to the publisher, you think it’ll be a bestseller! However, your strong conscience gets in the way. How will the witch feel about this? What if she finds out about it, and is angry, or upset. Is exploiting her really worth all the acclaim? You have a decision to make: </p>

Together, you pull the thing out to the center of the room. "Why do you need a cauldron this big?" you ask. The witch cackles. She cackles and cackles, till tears fill her eyes.

With Benji by your side again, you make your way back home. You didn't even feel like going to the castle anymore, it could't be more amazing than your new dog! You pass it, and return to the obstacle filled path you had travelled this morning. This time however, when the bees begin chasing you, you have a protector. Benji barks and growls, until the swarm goes away. You're stunned: where was that fearful little dog you had found earlier? "Thanks, Benji!" </p>

      <p> You and Benji go home. As you set up a bed for him from some blankets and pillows, you're grateful for today's adventure, it brought you your new friend! </p>

You crouch behind a shrub. They look around the porch, until they spot the little white dog. "Cloud!" the man calls out as he picks up the dog you had come to know as Benji. The people fawn over the little animal, and he looks so excited to see them. They put a red collar on his neck. "There," the woman says, "so you'll never get lost again." Benji and the family begin making their way back into the house, when he turns around and looks at you. He begins barking, and trying to wrestle in the man's arms but soon they are all inside the house. <em> I guess Benji had owners all this time</em>, you think to yourself. Still, you can't help but be sad that your new friendship couldn't last. You make your way home, ignoring all possibilities of adventure; it just wasn't the same without the little dog. Once home, you slump onto your bed, reliving the memories of the day, and being glad that you at least had a few hours with the little dog. </p>
